# Powershell script
This script is an attempt to autofill a spreadsheet with data scraped from Dell, Lenovo, and HP websites. Playwright is used to access the Dell and Lenovo websites in order to check which serial numbers line up and fill in data in a spreadsheet relating to make/model/and type of computer (ex: laptop, desktop).

I made this in order to speed up the process of filling out data on an excel sheet that tracks types of computers when a serial number is inputted.
